## Cable Networks

- Cable television is a system of providing television to consumers via radio frequency signals transmitted to televisions through <u>fixed optical fibers or coaxial cables</u> as opposed to the over-the-air method used in traditional television broadcasting in which a television antenna is required.
- It was called **community antenna TV (CATV)** because an
  antenna at the top ofa tall hill or building received the signals from the TV stations and distributed them, V1a coaxial cables, to the community.
  The cable TV office, called the head end, receives video
  signals from broadcasting stations and feeds the signals intO
  coaxial cables.
