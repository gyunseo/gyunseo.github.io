## Cable Networks

- Cable television is a system of providing television to consumers via radio frequency signals transmitted to televisions through <u>fixed optical fibers or coaxial cables</u> as opposed to the over-the-air method used in traditional television broadcasting in which a television antenna is required.
- It was called **community antenna TV (CATV)** because an antenna at the top of a tall hill or building received the signals from the TV stations and distributed them, via coaxial cables, to the community.
- The cable TV office, called the **head end**, receives video signals from broadcasting stations and feeds the signals into coaxial cables.
  - Cable television **head end** is <u>a master facility for receiving television signals for processing and distribution</u> over a cable television system.
